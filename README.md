# Bundibugyo Ebola virus outbreak 2026
Data for the 2026 Bundibugyo Ebolavirus (BDBV) outbreak.

This is work done in support of the current response led by colleagues in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

# Data contract

**Join key:** the canonical `Nom` from `data/shapefiles/DRC_Health_zones.shp`. The two natural collisions (`Bili`, `Lubunga`) are disambiguated with a province suffix, e.g. `Lubunga (Tshopo)`. Observed spellings that differ are listed in `data/aliases.csv`.

**Processed-file naming:** `<dataset>__<metric>__<resolution>.{csv|matrix.csv}`
- `<dataset>` and `<metric>` are lower_snake_case.
- `<resolution>` ∈ {`static`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly`}.
- Suffix is `.matrix.csv` for matrix outputs, `.csv` for vector (one-row-per-zone) outputs.

**Vector files** carry a `nom` column. Non-static resolutions also carry a `date` column (ISO 8601).
**Matrix files** layout: snapshot matrices have header `nom, <dest_nom_1>, ...`; time-series matrices have `date, nom, <dest_nom_1>, ...`. Cells are non-negative numeric.

# Contributor flow

0. One-time setup (anyone cloning):
   ```
   git lfs install
   python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
   ```
   LFS is required because binary raw blobs (`*.xlsx`, `*.zip`, `*.pdf`, `*.tif`, etc.) under `data/*/raw/` are stored via Git LFS — see `.gitattributes`.
1. Create `data/<your_dataset>/` with `raw/`, `metadata.yaml`, and (when you have outputs) `process.{py,R}` + `processed/`.
2. Make sure your processed filenames match the contract above. Add any name aliases your data uses to `data/aliases.csv`.
3. Run unit tests + QA locally:
   ```
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/
   .venv/bin/python -m tools.qa
   ```
4. Rebuild the merged GeoJSON if you changed any vector data:
   ```
   .venv/bin/python -m tools.build_geojson
   ```
5. Open a PR. CI runs `pytest` + `tools.qa` and blocks merge on any failures. Merges to `main` are manual.
